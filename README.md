# Weather API Dashboard Homework 6

For this project, we have created a application that takes an inputted location and gives back weather from that location. A display will pop up, one with current weather and another with a 5 day view. 

# Why

We wanted an app that lets you pick where you want to show weather. For those who like to know how it is outside and plan accordingly.

# The Process

First we start off with a basic html, linking Bootstrap and the necessary JavaScript/jQuery files. Then we add are basic skeleton of the website, making your navbar, then search bar, then containers to dynamically insert your JavaScript into. I started with dynamically adding the cards into our base form by creating functions that put the user's input into an array that displays on the page. Then we add the API calls form OpenWeatehrAPI, using ajax as a way to call it. We do this again calling the 5 day information from the OpenWeatherAPI. After that, we store the cities called to the user's local storage that pulls the last input when they return.
